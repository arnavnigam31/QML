# GSoC 2025 QMLHEP Test and Proposal

Problem statement can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1imoMEyC0r5IESonwgA7BThEQWDfdrOsoyfMfyJgyXmU/edit?tab=t.0)

## General Approach 
**Task 1**: This was a straight forward and simple implementation of Quantum circuit.

**Task 2**: We have to build a GNN for classification of Gluon/Quark particles. For this I have implemented 4 different type of GNN and evaluated them based on their accuracy.

**Task 3**: It was a open task, I wrote about QML and about different Algorithms.

**Task 4**: We had to build a QGAN using tensorflow or cirq for High Energy Data analysis

**Task 5**: Extended Task 2 with Quantum GNN 

**Task 6**: Implemented Quantum Representation learning on MNIST dataset

**Task 7**: Generate a dataset of Z_2 x Z_2 symmetry and implemented QNN on it.

**Task 8**: Implemented Vision Transformer on MNIST dataset, extended the architecture for Quantum Vision Transformer

**Task 9**: Implemented KAN using B-spline on MNSIT dataset, extended the architecture for Quantum KAN

**Task 11**: Designed a MLE to estimate PQC parameters




## Installation and Setup

 **Create a new Conda environment**  
Run the following command to create a new Conda environment with the same dependencies:

```sh
conda create --name qml_task --file dependencies.txt
```
**Activate the Environment**
```sh
conda activate qml_task
```

**Clone the Repo**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/arnavnigam31/QML.git
```
