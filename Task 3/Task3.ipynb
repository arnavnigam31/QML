    "During my research internship at DRDO, I worked extensively with Large Language Models (LLMs) and observed that the sheer size of the dataset and the high computational requirements posed significant challenges. Training these models demands vast memory resources and immense computational power, making efficiency a critical concern. However, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers promising solutions to optimize and accelerate this process.\n",

Classical matrix multiplication is computationally expensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional matrices.\n",

    "The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed to solve linear systems exponentially faster than classical methods.\n",
